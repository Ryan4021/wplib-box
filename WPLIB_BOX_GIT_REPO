The WPLib Box GitHub repo is designed to be used as a base for the WordPress projects
of box users and thus should not have git origin=github.com/wplib/wplib-box.git.

If this file is here the /scripts/guest/provision.sh that is run on `vagrant up` will
delete this file then delete the WPLib project .git directory (/vagrant/.git) so as
to disassociate this directory with the WPLib Box repo on GitHub.  It will also run a
`git init` to create a new Git directory.

You can reassociate in case you are actually working on updates to the wplib-box repo itself
by using this command:

    box reassociate-box-git-repo
