The WPLib Box GitHub repo is designed to be used as a base for the WordPress projects
of box users and thus should not have git origin=github.com/wplib/wplib-box.git.

If this file is here when /scripts/guest/provision.sh that is run during `vagrant up`
then /.git will be renamed /.wplib-box.git and this file will be moved into that
directory and run a `git init` to create a new /.git directory. thus this directory
will have been disassociated with the WPLib Box repo on GitHub.

You can reassociate in case you are actually working on updates to the wplib-box repo itself
by using this command:

    box reassociate-box-git-repo
